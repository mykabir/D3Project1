Project 1: Visualizing time series data - is the first project of CS5331-004: Visualization and Visual Analytics - Fall 2016 course. Tommy Dang (Tuan Nhon Dang), is teaching this course. 

I am fortunate that, I get a chance to work on this project.  It was amazing. I learn many things in last few days. 

In this project, I tried to show the unemployment rate of the different states of the USA from 1978 to 2016. The data is available in Bureau of Labor and Statistics. 

There were many tasks in the project. As I am new in D3 and I had a little time I tried to complete some important tasks. 

In my project, you can get a quick idea of the present unemployment condition as well as from 1978. It will be easy to compare the rate in the different year. A viewer also can zoom in quickly to check last 12 month, 5 years, 10 Years, 20 years or all the data of any state. 
More details and source codes can be found [here](https://github.com/mykabir/D3Project1) or [online demo](http://mykabir.info/d3Project1/).


I would like to show some interesting finding from the chart. From the graph, we can easily get an idea about the change of unemployment rate of different decades. 

### In every January, February, and March Montana states unemployment rate became higher than any other months. January is the highest!
